### Introduction

Hi, my name is Bhargavi and this my final project for COMSC334: Artificial Intelligence! 

**Project Goal**: Build on the Bayesian networks we studied in class and use them to understand causality and probabilistic graphical models.

#### Why does causality matter?

Many fields, from economics to UI/UX, are fundamentally about understanding complex systems and making better decisions. We can't do that without understanding the cause and effect relationships involved.

#### Sources:

My main source for this project was **Elements of Causal Inference** by Jonas Peters, Dominik Janzing, and Bernhard Schölkopf. 

I focused on chapter 2, which covers assumptions for causal inference and chapter 3, which covers cause-effect models.

I used code and visualizations to help build the intuition behind causality and how we can begin to model it.
